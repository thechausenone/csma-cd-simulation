# csma-cd-simulation
ECE 358 - Lab 2

## Running the Simulation:
To run a question:

    python3 main/main.py num

where 'num' is the question number 1 or 2

## Output:
### Question 1
The program prints the persistent simulator efficiency and throughput for given arrival rates and
number of nodes. The data is also outputted to `output.csv` in the form of 
[arrival_rate, num_nodes, efficiency, throughput].
### Question 2
The program prints the non-persistent simulator efficiency and throughput for given arrival rates
and number of nodes. The data is also outputted to `output.csv` in the form of 
[arrival_rate, num_nodes, efficiency, throughput].
